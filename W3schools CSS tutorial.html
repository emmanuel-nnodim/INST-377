<h1>This is a tutorial on how to use CSS</h1>
<p>CSS is a language that describes the style of an HTML document and how HTML elements are displayed.</p>
<p>Css Stands for <b>Cascading style sheets.</b>External style sheets are stored in CSS files</p>

<h2>CSS Structure</h2>
<p><b>CSS Syntax.</b> <br>The selector points to the HTML element you want to style. The declaration block contains one or more
    declarations seperated by semicolons. Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, seperated by a semicolon.
    A CSS declaration always end with a semicolon, and the declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.

<p id="para2">The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element. The id should be unique
    within a page since it's used to select one unique element. An id name cannot start with a numberThis paragraph utilizes an id selector. 
</p>

<p class="center">The class selector selects elements with a specific class attribute. To select class elements write a (.) period 
    followed by the class name. You can also specify when an HTMl elements should be affected by writing
    (p.center or h1.center)
</p>
<p class=" center large">HTMl elements can also refer to more than one class.</p>

<p>If you have elements with the same style definitions it will be better to group the selectors. EX: h1,h2,p{.....}</p>
